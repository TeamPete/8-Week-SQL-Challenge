# About this Project: The 8 Week SQL Challenge
Welcome to the repository that contains my solutions to the **[8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**!

This challenge is an online initiative created by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/), aimed at helping individuals improve their SQL skills in a practical and interactive way. The challenge consists of eight weekly tasks or scenarios that participants need to solve using SQL queries. Each task is designed to simulate real-world scenarios commonly encountered in data analysis or database management roles.

The following solutions will demonstrate my ability to write SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from databases. This includes skills such as selecting, filtering, aggregating, joining, and sorting data.
