## Problem Summary
Danny has launched Pizza Runner, aiming to revolutionize pizza delivery by combining the 80s retro style with the Uber model. He's recruited "runners" to deliver pizzas and developed a mobile app for ordering. Now, he needs help cleaning his data and applying calculations to optimize operations. We'll be working with datasets within the `pizza_runner` database schema to tackle this challenge.

### SQL Topics Covered:
- Joins
- Aggregate functions
- Data cleaning (string functions, handling NULL values)
- Common table expressions
- Temporary tables

## Creating Our Database Schema
Upon opening a new SQL script on MySQL Workbench, we will create the `pizza_runner` database along with the `runners`, `customer_orders`,  `runner_orders`, `pizza_names`, `pizza_recipes` and `pizza_toppings` tables. Then we will populate the tables with the data that Danny has provided us.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pizza_runner;
USE pizza_runner;

-- Create the runners table
CREATE TABLE runners (
  runner_id INTEGER,
  registration_date DATE
);

-- Insert data into the runners table
INSERT INTO runners (runner_id, registration_date)

## Cleaning the Data
Before we move onto answering questions, we notice that some of the data that Danny provided has some problems, particularly in the `customer_orders` and `runner_orders` tables!

When we take a look at the `customer_orders` table, we notice that there are empty and 'null' strings in the `exclusions` and `extras` fields.
| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time          |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-01 18:05:02 |
| 2        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-01 19:00:52 |
| 3        | 102         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-02 23:51:23 |
| 3        | 102         | 2        |            | NULL   | 2021-01-02 23:51:23 |
| 4        | 103         | 1        | 4          |        | 2021-01-04 13:23:46 |
| 4        | 103         | 1        | 4          |        | 2021-01-04 13:23:46 |
| 4        | 103         | 2        | 4          |        | 2021-01-04 13:23:46 |
| 5        | 104         | 1        | null       | 1      | 2021-01-08 21:00:29 |
| 6        | 101         | 2        | null       | null   | 2021-01-08 21:03:13 |
| 7        | 105         | 2        | null       | 1      | 2021-01-08 21:20:29 |
| 8        | 102         | 1        | null       | null   | 2021-01-09 23:54:33 |
| 9        | 103         | 1        | 4          | 1, 5   | 2021-01-10 11:22:59 |
| 10       | 104         | 1        | null       | null   | 2021-01-11 18:34:49 |
| 10       | 104         | 1        | 2, 6       | 1, 4   | 2021-01-11 18:34:49 |

Let's handle this by making all empty and 'null' strings consistent by making them all `NULL`. Once we do, we can ensure consistent data for smooth and accurate analysis. To do this, let's use data manipulation language (DML) to set values `NULL` where I found empty or 'null' strings for both relevant fields.
```sql
UPDATE customer_orders
SET exclusions = NULL
WHERE exclusions IN ('null', '');

UPDATE customer_orders
SET extras = NULL
WHERE extras IN ('null', '');
```

Our `customer_orders` table is now clean!
| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time          |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| 1        | 101         | 1        | NULL       | NULL   | 2021-01-01 18:05:02 |
| 2        | 101         | 1        | NULL       | NULL   | 2021-01-01 19:00:52 |
| 3        | 102         | 1        | NULL       | NULL   | 2021-01-02 23:51:23 |
| 3        | 102         | 2        | NULL       | NULL   | 2021-01-02 23:51:23 |
| 4        | 103         | 1        | 4          | NULL   | 2021-01-04 13:23:46 |
| 4        | 103         | 1        | 4          | NULL   | 2021-01-04 13:23:46 |
| 4        | 103         | 2        | 4          | NULL   | 2021-01-04 13:23:46 |
| 5        | 104         | 1        | NULL       | 1      | 2021-01-08 21:00:29 |
| 6        | 101         | 2        | NULL       | NULL   | 2021-01-08 21:03:13 |
| 7        | 105         | 2        | NULL       | 1      | 2021-01-08 21:20:29 |
| 8        | 102         | 1        | NULL       | NULL   | 2021-01-09 23:54:33 |
| 9        | 103         | 1        | 4          | 1, 5   | 2021-01-10 11:22:59 |
| 10       | 104         | 1        | NULL       | NULL   | 2021-01-11 18:34:49 |
| 10       | 104         | 1        | 2, 6       | 1, 4   | 2021-01-11 18:34:49 |

When we observe the `runner_orders` table, there are also empty and 'null' strings. In addition, we notice that fields like `distance` and `duration` are `VARCHAR` fields that contain actual numbers we might want to use to make calculations.
| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance | duration    | cancellation          |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1        | 1         | 2021-01-01 18:15:34 | 20km     | 32 minutes  |                       |
| 2        | 1         | 2021-01-01 19:10:54 | 20km     | 27 minutes  |                       |
| 3        | 1         | 2021-01-03 00:12:37 | 13.4km   | 20 mins     | NULL                  |
| 4        | 2         | 2021-01-04 13:53:03 | 23.4     | 40          | NULL                  |
| 5        | 3         | 2021-01-08 21:10:57 | 10       | 15          | NULL                  |
| 6        | 3         | null                | null     | null        | Restaurant Cancellation |
| 7        | 2         | 2021-01-08 21:30:45 | 25km     | 25mins      | null                  |
| 8        | 2         | 2021-01-10 00:15:02 | 23.4 km  | 15 minute   | null                  |
| 9        | 2         | null                | null     | null        | Customer Cancellation |
| 10       | 1         | 2021-01-11 18:50:20 | 10km     | 10minutes   | null                  |

Let's start out doing the same thing we did for the `customer_orders` table by setting values to `NULL` where we find empty and 'null' strings.
```sql
UPDATE runner_orders
SET cancellation = NULL
WHERE cancellation IN ('null', '');

UPDATE runner_orders
SET pickup_time = NULL,
  distance = NULL,
  duration = NULL
WHERE order_id IN (6, 9);
```
Great! Let's move onto the `distance` field. To properly clean `distance`, we must convert this field from `VARCHAR` to `DECIMAL` in order to make calculations. However, we must trim out the unnecessary spaces and units 'km' beforehand.

First, I start off by removing 'km' from the tail of these values where 'km' is found. I use a combination of the `LEFT()` and `LENGTH()` functions to remove 'km'. Then, use `RTRIM()` to remove all the trailing spaces.
```sql
UPDATE runner_orders
SET distance = LEFT(distance, LENGTH(distance) - 2)
WHERE LOWER(distance) LIKE '%km';

UPDATE runner_orders
SET distance = RTRIM(distance);
```

We can do the same approach for our `duration` field. However, I use the `SUBSTRING_INDEX()` function to substring each duration value with units. Then trim all trailing spaces.
```sql
UPDATE runner_orders
SET duration = SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, 'm', 1)
WHERE duration LIKE '%min%';

UPDATE runner_orders
SET duration = RTRIM(duration);
```

Now that we've cleaned both `distance` and `duration` fields, let's convert them to `DECIMAL(3, 1)` and `INTEGER` respectively. We will also rename them to clarify the units being used.
```sql
ALTER TABLE runner_orders
CHANGE distance distance_km DECIMAL(3,1);

ALTER TABLE runner_orders
CHANGE duration duration_min INT;
```

Our `runner_orders` table is clean, and we are ready to do some analysis!
| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance_km | duration_min | cancellation          |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 1        | 1         | 2021-01-01 18:15:34 | 20.0        | 32           | NULL                  |
| 2        | 1         | 2021-01-01 19:10:54 | 20.0        | 27           | NULL                  |
| 3        | 1         | 2021-01-03 00:12:37 | 13.4        | 20           | NULL                  |

## A. Pizza Metrics - Answers and Solutions
### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_pizzas
FROM
  customer_orders;
```

**Steps:**
- Simply use the function `COUNT()` to count every row from the `customer_orders` table.

**Output:**
| num_pizzas |
|-------------|
| 14 |

There were 14 pizzas ordered.

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_orders
FROM
  customer_orders;
```
**Steps:**
- Simply use the function `COUNT()` to count every `DISTINCT order_id` from the `customer_orders` table.
  
**Output:**
| unique_orders |
|-------------|
| 10 |

There were 10 unique customer orders.

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  COUNT(runner_id) AS successful_orders
FROM
  runner_orders
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY
  runner_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Use the **WHERE** clause to filter results where the `cancellation` field is `NULL`. When `cancellation` is `NULL` that means we have a successful delivery.
- We want to group the orders by `runner_id` by using the **GROUP BY** clause, then the aggregate function `COUNT()` to count each successful delivery.

**Output:**
| runner_id | successful_orders |
|------|------|
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |

Runner 1 made 4 successful orders, runner 2 had 3 successful orders, and runner 3 had 1 successful order.

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
**Answer:**
```sql
WITH successful_delivery AS (
  SELECT
    order_id,
    CASE
      WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 'Yes'
      ELSE 'No'
    END AS delivery
  FROM
    runner_orders
)
SELECT
  pizza_names.pizza_name,
  COUNT(customer_orders.pizza_id) AS num_deliveries
FROM
  customer_orders
JOIN
  successful_delivery
  ON successful_delivery.order_id = customer_orders.order_id
JOIN
  pizza_names
  ON pizza_names.pizza_id = customer_orders.pizza_id
WHERE
  successful_delivery.delivery = 'Yes'
GROUP BY
  pizza_names.pizza_name;
```

**Steps:**
- Use a common table expression to **JOIN** a 'Yes' or 'No' field onto the `customer_orders` table based on `order_id`. This new field will determine whether the delivery was successful or not for each particular pizza order.
- Use another **JOIN** to combine rows from the `pizza_names` table onto the `customer_orders` table based on `pizza_id` in order to obtain the `pizza_name` of each order.
- Use the **WHERE** clause to filter the results where `successful_delivery.delivery` is 'Yes'.
- Group the results by `pizza_name` using the **GROUP BY** clause. Use the aggregate function `COUNT()` to count the number of successful deliveries for each `pizza_name`.
  
**Output:**
| pizza_name | num_deliveries |
|------------|------|
| Meatlovers | 9 |
| Vegetarian | 3 |

Meatlovers was delivered 9 times, and vegetarian was delivered 3 times.

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  customer_orders.customer_id,
  pizza_names.pizza_name,
  COUNT(pizza_names.pizza_name) AS num_orders
FROM
  customer_orders
JOIN
  pizza_names
  ON pizza_names.pizza_id = customer_orders.pizza_id
GROUP BY
  customer_orders.customer_id,
  pizza_names.pizza_name
ORDER BY
  customer_orders.customer_id,
  pizza_names.pizza_name DESC;
```

**Steps:**
- Use **JOIN** to combine rows from the `pizza_names` table onto to the `customer_orders` table based on `pizza_id` in order to obtain the `pizza_names` for each order.
- Group the results by `customer_id` and `pizza_name` using the **GROUP BY** clause, then use the aggregate function `COUNT()` to count the number of orders for each customer and pizza name.
- Make sure to use the **ORDER BY** clause to sort our results by `customer_id` and `pizza_name`, obtaining an organized result!

**Output:**
| customer_id | pizza_name | num_orders |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 101         | Vegetarian | 1          |
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2          |
| 102         | Vegetarian | 1          |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 2          |
| 103         | Vegetarian | 1          |
| 103         | Meatlovers | 3          |
| 104         | Meatlovers | 3          |
| 105         | Vegetarian | 1          |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  MAX(num_pizzas)
FROM (
  SELECT
    c.order_id,
    COUNT(c.order_id) AS num_pizzas
  FROM
    customer_orders c
  JOIN
    runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
  WHERE
    r.cancellation IS NULL
  GROUP BY
    c.order_id
) AS orders;
```

**Steps:**
- In the subquery, we get a table where count the number of pizzas for each `order_id` from the `customer_orders` table by using the **GROUP BY** clause and the aggregate function `COUNT()`.
    - We also **JOIN** the runner_orders based on `order_id` to then filter successful deliveries through the **WHERE** clause.
- We then use the `MAX()` function to get the highest number of pizzas delievered in a single order.
  
**Output:**
| MAX(num_pizzas) |
|------|
| 3 |

The most pizzas a successful delivery had was 3.

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  customer_orders.customer_id,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN customer_orders.exclusions IS NOT NULL
        OR customer_orders.extras IS NOT NULL
        THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS changed,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN customer_orders.exclusions IS NULL
        AND customer_orders.extras IS NULL
        THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END
  ) AS not_changed
FROM
  customer_orders 
JOIN
  runner_orders
  ON runner_orders.order_id = customer_orders.order_id
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY
  customer_orders.customer_id
ORDER BY
  customer_orders.customer_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Use **JOIN** to combine rows from the `runner_orders` table with the `customer_orders` table based on `order_id` to then filter our results where `cancellation` is `NULL`.
    - This will allow us to deal with only successful deliveries.
- To determine whether there is a change in a pizza, we want to check whether `exclusions` and `extras` are both `NULL`.
  - Create two additional fields in the `SELECT` statement using `CASE` expressions: `changed` and `not_changed`.
  - We will count an order as `changed` when either the `exclusions` or `extras` fields are `NOT NULL`. We will count an order as `not_changed` when both `exclusions` and `extras` fields are `NULL`.
- Use the aggregate function `SUM()` to total each `CASE` expression/new field. Group the results by `customer_id` using the **GROUP BY** clause.
- Sort the results by `customer_id`.

**Output:**
| customer_id | changed | not_changed |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 101         | 0 | 2          |
| 102         | 0 | 3          |
| 103         | 3 | 0          |
| 104         | 2 | 1          |
| 105         | 1 | 0          |

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN customer_orders.exclusions IS NOT NULL
        AND customer_orders.extras IS NOT NULL
        THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS had_both_exclusions_and_extras
FROM
  customer_orders 
JOIN
  runner_orders
  ON runner_orders.order_id = customer_orders.order_id
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL
ORDER BY
  customer_orders.customer_id;
 ```

**Steps:**
- The answer will be pretty much the same as the one in the previous question. However, the `SELECT` statement will be different.
- This time we create a different field using the `CASE` expression.
  - Check whether both `exclusions` and `extras` fields are `NOT NULL`, then use `SUM()` to total the cases.

**Output:**
| had_both_exclusions_and_extras |
|-------------|
| 1         |

Only 1 pizza had both exclusions and extras.

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
**Answer:**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE all_hours AS (
  SELECT
    0 AS num
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    num + 1
  FROM
    all_hours
  WHERE
    num < 23
)
SELECT
  all_hours.num,
  COUNT(customer_orders.order_id) AS total_pizzas_ordered
FROM
  all_hours
LEFT JOIN
  customer_orders
  ON all_hours.num = HOUR(customer_orders.order_time)
GROUP BY
  all_hours.num
ORDER BY
  all_hours.num;
```

**Steps:**
- Under a common table expression, we use recursion to create a table `all_hours` with all numbered hours in a day (0 through 23).
- In the main query, we will then **JOIN** `all_hours` onto the `customer_orders` table based on `HOUR(customer_orders.order_time)`.
- Group the results by each hour of the day, `all_hours.num` using the **GROUP BY** clause. Then, use the aggregate function `COUNT()` to count each order in each hour.

**Output:**
| num | total_pizzas_ordered |
|-----|----------------------|
| 0   | 0                    |
| 1   | 0                    |
| 2   | 0                    |
| 3   | 0                    |
| 4   | 0                    |
| 5   | 0                    |
| 6   | 0                    |
| 7   | 0                    |
| 8   | 0                    |
| 9   | 0                    |
| 10  | 0                    |
| 11  | 1                    |
| 12  | 0                    |
| 13  | 3                    |
| 14  | 0                    |
| 15  | 0                    |
| 16  | 0                    |
| 17  | 0                    |
| 18  | 3                    |
| 19  | 1                    |
| 20  | 0                    |
| 21  | 3                    |
| 22  | 0                    |
| 23  | 3                    |

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
**Answer:**
First, create a temporary table to then populate it with the days of the week.
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE days_of_the_week (
  num INT,
  day VARCHAR(9)
);

INSERT INTO days_of_the_week (num, day)
VALUES (1, 'Sunday'), (2, 'Monday'), (3, 'Tuesday'), (4, 'Wednesday'), (5, 'Thursday'), (6, 'Friday'), (7, 'Saturday');
```

Then we can write our answer query:
```sql
SELECT
  days_of_the_week.day,
  COUNT(customer_orders.order_id) AS num_orders
FROM
  days_of_the_week
LEFT JOIN
  customer_orders
  ON DAYOFWEEK(customer_orders.order_time) = days_of_the_week.num
GROUP BY
  days_of_the_week.day;
```

**Steps:**
- Use **LEFT JOIN** to join our newly created `days_of_the_week` table onto the `customer_orders` table based on `DAYOFWEEK(customer_orders.order_time) = days_of_the_week.num`.
- Group the results by day of the week using the **GROUP BY** clause. Then, use the aggregate function `COUNT()` to count the number of orders in each day of the week.

**Output:**
| day       | num_orders |
|-----------|------------|
| Sunday    | 1          |
| Monday    | 5          |
| Tuesday   | 0          |
| Wednesday | 0          |
| Thursday  | 0          |
| Friday    | 5          |
| Saturday  | 3          |

## B. Runner and Customer Experience - Answers and Solutions
### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts `2021-01-01`)
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  WEEK(DATE_ADD(registration_date, INTERVAL 2 DAY), 0) AS week_number,
  COUNT(*) AS registrations
FROM
  runners
GROUP BY
  week_number;
```

**Steps:**
- Use the `WEEK()` function to extract the week number of the `registration_date` field.
- Because new year's day occurred on a Friday in 2021 and Sunday starts the week number count, the `WEEK()` function will return 0. We want week numbers to be aligned with each 7 day intervals since new year's day.
  - To fix this, we will add two days the `registration_date` field by using the `DATE_ADD()` function. 
- Group the results by week number and use the aggregate function `COUNT()` to count the number of registrations for each week number.

**Output:**
| week_number  | registrations |
|-----------|------------|
| 1    | 2          |
| 2    | 1          |
| 3   | 1          |

During week one, 2 runners had signed up. In each of weeks two and three, 1 runner signed up.

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
**Answer:**
```sql
WITH order_to_pickup_times AS
(
  SELECT
    runner_orders.runner_id, runner_orders.order_id,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute, customer_orders.order_time, runner_orders.pickup_time)) AS arrival_durations
  FROM
    runner_orders
  JOIN
    customer_orders
    ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
  WHERE
    cancellation IS NULL
  GROUP BY
    runner_orders.runner_id,
    runner_orders.order_id
)
SELECT
  runner_id,
  ROUND(AVG(arrival_durations), 2) AS avg_order_to_pickup_minutes
FROM
  order_to_pickup_times
GROUP BY
  runner_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Create a common table expression that outputs time differences between `order_time` and `pickup_time`.
    - In this query, use **JOIN** to combine rows from `runner_orders` with `customer_orders` based on `order_id`.
    - Then, use the `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` function to calculate differences between `order_time` and `pickup_time` in minutes.
    - Excluse rows where `cancellation` is `NULL` using the **WHERE** clause.
    - Because there will be multiple rows for the same `runner_id` and `order_id`, we need to use **GROUP BY** to group the results by each runner and order. We need to use the aggregate function `AVG()` to average the time differences but it won't change anything.
- In the main query, we use `AVG()` to take the average of the `order_time` to `pickup_time` durations for each `runner_id`.

**Output:**
| runner_id | avg_order_to_pickup_minutes |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| 1         | 14.00                       |
| 2         | 19.67                       |
| 3         | 10.00                       |

Runner 1 had an average order-to-pickup time of 14 minutes, runner 2 had an average order-to-pickup time of 19.67 minutes, and runner 3 had an average order-to-pickup time of 10 minutes.

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
**Answer:**
```sql
WITH order_and_prep_time AS
(
  SELECT
    customer_orders.order_id,
    COUNT(pizza_id) AS number_of_pizzas,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, customer_orders.order_time, runner_orders.pickup_time)) AS prep_time
  FROM
    customer_orders
  JOIN
    runner_orders
    ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
  WHERE
    cancellation IS NULL
  GROUP BY
    customer_orders.order_id
)
SELECT
  number_of_pizzas,
  ROUND(AVG(prep_time), 2) AS avg_prep_time_minutes
FROM
  order_and_prep_time
GROUP BY
  number_of_pizzas;
```
**Steps:**
- Create a common table expression that outputs time differences between `order_time` and `pickup_time`.
    - In this query, use **JOIN** to combine rows from `runner_orders` with `customer_orders` based on `order_id`.
    - Then, use the `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` function to calculate differences between `order_time` and `pickup_time` in minutes.
    - Excluse rows where `cancellation` is `NULL` using the **WHERE** clause.
    - Because there will be multiple rows for the same `order_id`, we need to use **GROUP BY** to group the results by each order id. We need to use the aggregate function `AVG()` to average the time differences but it won't change anything.
    - Lastly, use `COUNT()` to count the number of pizzas for each order.
- In the main query, group the results by number of pizzas and average the prep times.

**Output:**
| number_of_pizzas | avg_prep_time_minutes |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1                | 12.00                 |
| 2                | 18.00                 |
| 3                | 29.00                 |

This relationship suggests that preparing more pizzas requires additional time, likely due to the increased workload involved in making multiple pizzas.

### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
**Answer:**
```sql
WITH order_customer_pair AS (
  SELECT
    order_id,
    ROUND(AVG(customer_id), 0) AS customer_id
  FROM
    customer_orders
  GROUP BY
    order_id
)

SELECT
  order_customer_pair.customer_id,
  ROUND(AVG(distance_km), 2) AS avg_distance_traveled_km
FROM
  runner_orders
LEFT JOIN
  order_customer_pair ON order_customer_pair.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY
  order_customer_pair.customer_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Within a common table expression, write a query that outputs all the `order_id` and `customer_id` pairs.
- In the main query, use **JOIN** to combine rows from the newly created CTE with `runner_rders` based on `order_id`.
  - Excluse rows where `cancellation` is `NULL` using the **WHERE** clause.
  - Group the results by `customer_id` and use `AVG()` to take the average of `distance_km` for each customer.

**Output:**
| customer_id | avg_distance_traveled_km |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| 101         | 20.00                    |
| 102         | 18.40                    |
| 103         | 23.40                    |
| 104         | 10.00                    |
| 105         | 25.00                    |

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  MAX(duration_min)-MIN(duration_min)
FROM
  runner_orders
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL;
```

**Steps:**
- Use the `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions to calculate the difference between the longest and shortest `duration_min`.
- Excluse rows where `cancellation` is `NULL` using the **WHERE** clause.

**Output:**
| MAX(duration_min)-MIN(duration_min) |
|-------------|
| 30 |

The difference between the longest and shortest delivery times was 30 minutes.

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  order_id,
  ROUND(AVG((distance_km/duration_min)*60), 2) AS avg_km_per_hr,
  AVG(ROUND(AVG((distance_km/duration_min)*60), 2)) OVER(PARTITION BY runner_id) AS runner_avg_speed_km_per_hr
FROM
  runner_orders
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY
  runner_id,
  order_id
ORDER BY
  runner_id,
  order_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average of each `distance_km`/`duration_min` as this will calculate km per hour.
    - Then use a window function to calculate the average of the average speeds for each runner.
- Excluse rows where `cancellation` is `NULL` using the **WHERE** clause.
- Group the results by `runner_id` and `order_id` using the **GROUP BY** clause.
- Sort the results by `runner_id` and `order_id` using the **ORDER BY** clause.

**Output:**
| runner_id | order_id | avg_km_per_hr | runner_avg_speed_km_per_hr |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------------------|
| 1         | 1        | 37.50         | 45.535000                  |
| 1         | 2        | 44.44         | 45.535000                  |
| 1         | 3        | 40.20         | 45.535000                  |
| 1         | 10       | 60.00         | 45.535000                  |
| 2         | 4        | 35.10         | 62.900000                  |
| 2         | 7        | 60.00         | 62.900000                  |
| 2         | 8        | 93.60         | 62.900000                  |
| 3         | 5        | 40.00         | 40.000000                  |

There seems to be an increased average speed as the number of deliveries increases for each runner.

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  ROUND(
    SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) / COUNT(order_id), 2
  ) * 100 AS success_percentage
FROM
  runner_orders
GROUP BY
  runner_id
ORDER BY
  runner_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Use the `CASE` expression to create a new field that tells us whether the delivery was cancelled or not.
  - Use `SUM()` to total the cases and divide it by the number of orders using the aggregate function `COUNT()`.
 - Group the results by `runner_id`.

**Output:**
| runner_id | success_percentage |
|-----------|--------------------|
| 1         | 100.00             |
| 2         | 75.00              |
| 3         | 50.00              |

Runner 1 had a 100% successful delivery rate, runner 2 had a 75% successful delivery rate, and runner 3 had a 50% successful delivery rate.
